## How to

You can find information on that plugins pack in the [wiki](https://github.com/sebastien-bouffier/Bidoo/wiki). When doing tests it happens that I record a video so you may find some ideas on how to use those modules [here](https://www.youtube.com/bidoo).

## Last changes

13/02/2019 => 0.6.26
**bordL** pitch calibration and KEY input fix.
**REI** reverberator (based on freeverb with a pitchshifter in the feedback loop) has been redesigned and the control calibration is better than before, it still needs some adjustments.
**OUAIve** has a new input in the top right corner. When this input is triggered it overrides the sample position and take it back to 0 (I use it with **OUAIve** in grid mode without any POS input signal, so slices are read one after another at each trig, if I need to go back to 0 to sync with a sequencer I trig the new input :)).
**FFILTR** low pass filter based on FFT has a resonance control now.

20/11/2018 => 0.6.23

*NEW* **liMonADe** additive osc + wavetable synth. On the right side stand the usual controls for the oscillator. On the left side stand commands to manipulate the frames and the wavetable. From top to bottom and left to right :
* samples per frame (textbox) - frame selector
* load sample into wavetable - load png into wavetable - load sample into frame
* morph frames - morph spectrum - morph spectrum phase constant - delete morphing
* normalize all frames - remove DC offset of all frames - normalize wavetable - normalize frame
* window wavetable - smooth wavetable - window frame - smooth frame
* add frame - remove frame
* number of voices - voices detuning (voices detuning input)

there is one unused input it will be the entry point for sampling.

05/10/2018 => 0.6.19

*NEW* **PeNEqUe** additive osc. To scroll horizontally in bins => Shift + mouse. To set a bin to 0 Ctrl + Click. Top chart is magnitude and middle chart is phase.

*UPDATE* **dFUZE** has no shimmer param anymore, I was unsatisfied with the pitch shifting part of the plugin.

*UPDATE* **Garçon** flagged as VISUAL.

*UPDATE* **EMILE** does not use a sin wave table anymore, it is now based on IDFT.

*NEW* **HCTIP** pitch shifter, it is a test on fft pitch shifting technique.

23/09/2018 => 0.6.18

*NEW* **zOù MAï** sequencer first candidate. 8 patterns x 8 tracks x 64 steps with trim and probability/condition. Global swing per track is not implemented. For tracks and trigs select = left click and activate = right click. I will make a video asap in order to explain.

10/09/2018 => 0.6.17

*UPDATE* **dTrOY** and **bordL** fix quantization issue.

09/09/2018 => 0.6.16

*UPDATE* **lIMbO** cutoff frequency max value changed (calibration).

*UPDATE* **dTrOY** and **bordL** phase calculation now based on engine sample rate instead of clock() from ctime. V/Oct can't be synced with gates anymore it is continuous now. Quantization issue has been fixed. New input "Transpose" that comes after quantization (it is rescaled -4/+4 octaves on -10/+10V and sliced per 1/12 Volt). Copy/Paste is available in the UI => exit right click menu. "SHIFTS" allows you to move patterns left and right and pitch up and down.

*UPDATE* **LoURdE** threshold and factors displays are now yellow on black background.
