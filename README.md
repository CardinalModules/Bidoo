## How to

You can find information on that plugins pack in the [wiki](https://github.com/sebastien-bouffier/Bidoo/wiki). When doing tests it happens that I record a video so you may find some ideas on how to use those modules [here](https://www.youtube.com/bidoo).

## Last changes

0.5.15 TiARE is Fundamentals' VCO1 tweaked in order to perform phase distortion. If X and Y not connected you can change the phase distortion manually with the XY pad, if at least X or Y is connected then the pad displays the phase distortion values.
