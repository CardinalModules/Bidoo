## How to

You can find information on that plugins pack in the [wiki](https://github.com/sebastien-bouffier/Bidoo/wiki). When doing tests it happens that I record a video so you may find some ideas on how to use those modules [here](https://www.youtube.com/bidoo).

## Last changes

dTrOY pitch output can be switched between continuous and triggered modes.
lATe offset is rescaled according to input clock.
ForK is an oscillator based on a particular approach of formant synthesis.
It is the first attempt of an adaptation of Paul Sernine and Doc Rochebois's work (http://www.musicdsp.org/pdf/musicdsp.pdf).
Warning this model creates DC offset at high frequencies. Vowels sounds are more fun at low and mid frequencies.
